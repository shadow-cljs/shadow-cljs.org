shadow-cljs provides everything you need to compile your ClojureScript code with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

* Good configuration defaults so you don't have to sweat the details
* Seamless `npm` integration
* Fast builds, reliable caching, ...
* Supporting various targets `:browser`, `:node-script`, `:npm-module`, `:react-native`, `:chrome-extension`, ...
* Live Reload (CLJS + CSS)
* CLJS REPL
* Code splitting (via `:modules`)

To use shadow-cljs, add your configurations in a `shadow-cljs.edn` file, and run:

```bash
npm install -g shadow-cljs # Node.js and JVM are required to be installed

shadow-cljs compile app # `:app` is the build-id defined in shadow-cljs.edn
```

### Configurations

For a browser app, create a `shadow-cljs.edn` file like:

```clojure
{:source-paths ["src"]
 :dependencies [[reagent "0.8.1"]]
 :builds {:app {:target :browser
                :output-dir "public/js"
                :asset-path "/js"
                :modules {:main {:init-fn app.main/main!}}}}}
```

which means:

```clojure
{:source-paths ["src"] ; where you put source files

 :dependencies [[reagent "0.8.1"]] ; ClojureScript dependencies

        ; "app" is the build-id, in running "shadow-cljs compile app"
 :builds {:app {:target :browser ; compile code that loads in a browser
                :output-dir "public/js"
                :asset-path "/js" ; assets loaded from index.html are based on path "/js"

                        ; "main.js" is the name for the bundle entry
                :modules {:main {:init-fn app.main/main!}}}}}
                               ; function app.main.main! is called when page loads
```

Use `:target :node-script` [for compiling in Node.js](https://github.com/minimal-xyz/minimal-shadow-cljs-nodejs) and there are also [more targets to try](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_build_target).

To publish a ClojureScript package with dependencies from npm, add a [`dep.cljs`](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#publish-deps-cljs) file. shadow-cljs will read it and install those npm modules.

### CLI tools

Some useful shadow-cljs commands during development are:

```bash
# compile a build once and exit
shadow-cljs compile app

# compile and watch
shadow-cljs watch app

# connect to REPL for the build (available while watch is running)
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app

# connect to standalone node repl
shadow-cljs node-repl
```

Running a release build optimized for production use.

```bash
shadow-cljs release app
```

Find out more [commands in the docs](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_command_line).

### Using modules from npm

With shadow-cljs, most npm modules for browser can be imported with modules installed locally.

```clojure
(ns app.main
  (:require ["md5" :as md5]
            ["fs" :as fs]))

(println (md5 "text"))

(fs/readFileSync "deps.den" "utf8")
```

### Hot code swapping

shadow-cljs watches for file changes and re-compiles code incrementally. Warnings and errors are displayed after being prettified.

```clojure
{:source-paths ["src"]
 :dependencies [[mvc-works/hsl "0.1.2"]]
 :dev-http {8080 "target/"}
 :builds {:browser {:target :browser
                    :output-dir "target/browser"
                    :modules {:main {:init-fn app.main/main!}}

                    :devtools {:after-load app.main/reload!}}}}
```

### Non-code resources

There are various use-cases where youâ€™d want to use a static resource as part of the compilation of your source files. shadow-cljs provides a macro `shadow.resource/inline` for loading files from inside classpaths:

```clojure
(ns demo.app
  (:require [shadow.resource :as rc]))

(def docs (rc/inline "./docs.md")) ; docs is the string content of the file

; also like:
; (def docs (rc/inline "demo/docs.md"))
```

This will resolve the `./docs.md` file relative to the current namespace, which means it will end up including `demo/docs.md` from somewhere on the classpath.

### Long-term caching

By setting in `:module-hash-names` field you may tell shadow-cljs to add MD5 hash in the filenames generated. It's a trivial feature in Webpack and now it's a one-liner config in ClojureScript. Meanwhile the `assets.edn` file can be emitted for indexing js files in HTML.

```clojure
{:source-paths ["src"]
 :dependencies [[mvc-works/hsl "0.1.2"]]
 :builds {:browser {:target :browser
                    :output-dir "target/browser"
                    :modules {:main {:init-fn app.main/main!}}

                    :release {:output-dir "dist/"
                              :module-hash-names 8
                              :build-options {:manifest-name "assets.edn"}}}}}
```

After compilation, two files will be generated in `dist/` with names:

```
=>> l dist/
assets.edn        main.9683CD2F.js
```

### Other features
